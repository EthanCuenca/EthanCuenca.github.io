      <p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>

        <p> Date: April 21-23 FRI-SAT 7:30 Sunday 1:00 </p>
        <p> Featured Artists:
            Peter Oundjian: Conductor,
            James Ehnes: Violin</p>

        <p> Join your Colorado Symphony and Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian in welcoming acclaimed soloist
            and 2021 Gramophone Artist of the Year, James Ehnes, to Boettcher Concert Hall for a reinvigoration of
            Beethoven’s majestic Violin Concerto. Beethoven’s output in nearly every musical genre was prolific, yet
            surprisingly he wrote only one concerto for the violin. The four opening drum taps that begin this
            masterpiece remain one of the most surprising and audacious ideas that the composer ever committed to
            paper, setting the stage for a transcendent work that stands among the greats of the repertoire. Bruckner’s
            Seventh Symphony emphatically elevated him into the ranks of legendary 19th century composers in a
            work that is epic in scope and scale, with knowing nods to Beethoven’s Third Symphony and Wagner’s
            Ring Cycle, including his use of the famous Wagner tubas. This revered work caps an awe-inspiring
            program of inspiring masterworks led by Maestro Oundjian.</p>

        <p> Repertoire:
            BEETHOVEN Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 61
            BRUCKNER Symphony No. 7 in E major, WAB 107</p>
