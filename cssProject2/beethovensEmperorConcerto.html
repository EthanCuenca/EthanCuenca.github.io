      <p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>

        <p> Date: February 24-26 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00 </p>
        <p> Featured Artists:
            Teddy Abrams: Conductor,
            Stewart Goodyear: Piano</p>

        <p> One of the most accomplished of all piano works, Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto features a striking
            opening movement and a glorious finale, with beauty and virtuosic style throughout that makes it one of
            the composer’s best. Your Colorado Symphony welcomes electrifying pianist Stewart Goodyear who is
            just the firebrand to live up to the wiles of this majestic and vigorously demanding concerto.
            Teddy Abrams — Musical America
            ’s 2022 Conductor of the Year — brings dynamic flair to Perkinson’s
            energetic Worship Overture. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony was so well received that within months of its
            American premiere, a portrait of the composer was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Prokofiev
            wrote that he “conceived of it as glorifying the grandeur of the human spirit, praising the free and happy
            man— his strength, his generosity, and the purity of his soul." This heroic and joyous work offers a
            brilliant conclusion to a performance of energizing masterworks.</p>

        <p> Repertoire:
            PERKINSON Worship: A Concert Overture
            BEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73, “Emperor"
            PROKOFIEV Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, Op. 100</p>
