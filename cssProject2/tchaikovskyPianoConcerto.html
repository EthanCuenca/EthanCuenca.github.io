        Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern
      </h1>

      <p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>

        <p> Date: December 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00 </p>
        <p> Featured Artists:
          Christian Reif: Conductor,
          Olga Kern: Piano</p>

        <p> Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among
          the greats of the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with
          towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what
          Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all virtuosos must
          measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite
          Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this cornerstone of the Classical Canon.
          Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San
          Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth
          Symphony. Written to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and
          complex orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant
          note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.</p>

        <p> Repertoire:
          TCHAIKOVSKY Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat major, Op. 23
          SHOSTAKOVICH Symphony No. 10 in E minor, Op. 93</p>
