      <p><strong>About this Event</strong></p>

        <p> Date: November 4-6 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00 </p>
        <p> Featured Artists:
            Peter Oundjian: Conductor,

            Duain Wolfe: Director</p>

        <p> History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony,
            Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and
            Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is
            larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the
            forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future
            for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant
            recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring
            themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes
            center stage on Vaughan Williams ’Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable
            marriage of music and text, with Williams ’inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble,
            humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your
            Colorado Symphony.</p>

        <p> Repertoire:
            VAUGHAN WILLIAMS Toward the Unknown Region
            ELGAR Cello Concerto in E minor, Op. 85
            BEETHOVEN Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 55 “Eroica”</p>
