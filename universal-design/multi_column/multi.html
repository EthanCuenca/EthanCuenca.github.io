        <h2>About Spider-Man</h2>
        <p>Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is a superhero created by writer Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962). Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.</p>
        <p>Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, which gave him his superhuman abilities. He uses his powers to fight crime and protect the citizens of New York City, often facing off against iconic villains like the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and the Vulture.</p>
        <h2>About Venom</h2>
        <p>Venom is a symbiote, a sentient alien, with a gooey, almost liquid-like form. It requires a host, usually human, to bond with for its survival. The symbiote bestows its enhanced powers upon the host. Venom's first full appearance was in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988).</p>
        <p>Venom's most famous host is Eddie Brock, a journalist who becomes Venom after bonding with the symbiote. Together, they form a powerful and often unpredictable anti-hero, sometimes fighting against Spider-Man and other times teaming up with him to battle greater threats.</p>

        <h3>Venom's Powers</h3>
        <img src="/universal-design/multi_column/img/Venom_logo.png" alt="Venom Logo" class="center">
        <p>Venom grants its host enhanced physical strength, shape-shifting abilities, and the power to create web-like tendrils. It also has a unique ability to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense.</p>
        <p>Venom can also heal its host's injuries at an accelerated rate and has the ability to mimic the appearance of other people, making it a formidable foe in both combat and deception.</p>
