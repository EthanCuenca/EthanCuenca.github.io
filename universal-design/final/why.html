            <h1>Why Universal Design?</h1>
            <p>Universal design is important for multiple reasons. It’s not just about following legal regulations, but about creating a more inclusive and accessible web for everyone.</p>

                    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                    <p>Designing websites that everyone can access is an ethical imperative. With more than 1 billion people living with disabilities worldwide, universal design ensures that no one is excluded from digital spaces.</p>
                    <p>By applying universal design principles, you're promoting equality, diversity, and access to information for all users, regardless of their abilities or limitations.</p>

                    <h2>Practical Benefits</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wider Audience Reach:</strong> With universal design, you are catering to a larger group of people, including those who use assistive technologies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Accessible websites provide a better experience for all users, not just those with disabilities. For example, captions on videos help people with different preferences or learning styles.</li>
                        <li><strong>SEO Benefits:</strong> Websites built with accessibility in mind are more likely to rank well in search engines due to better semantic structure and content clarity.</li>

                    <h2>Universal Design and Legal Requirements</h2>
                    <p>In many countries, accessibility is not just a best practice—it's the law. By following universal design principles, you reduce the risk of legal challenges and ensure compliance with regulations such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S. or the European Accessibility Act in the EU.</p>
