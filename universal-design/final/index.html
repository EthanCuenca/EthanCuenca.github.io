                <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
                <p>Universal design is the practice of creating websites that are accessible and user-friendly for all people, regardless of their abilities, devices, or preferences. A universally designed website ensures that everyone can navigate, understand, and interact with it effectively.</p>
                <p>By applying universal design principles, you make the internet a more inclusive space for people with disabilities, the elderly, and even those who might be using assistive technologies. Universal design isn't just about accessibilityâ€”it's about enhancing the user experience for all.</p>

                    <p>By prioritizing accessibility, you tap into a larger audience and demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity.</p>
