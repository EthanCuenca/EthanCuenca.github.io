            <h2>Art Work</h2>        
            <p>I really enjoy art both digital and traditional. Most of my drawings start with pencil/pen and paper and then further 
                get pushed to the digital side where I can finish up with shading. Very few pieces come out to see full color since I 
                prefer to do most of my art in black and white; I find it much easier to control shading over coloring.</p>
            <p>Below are some of my favorite pieces that I have done, some are colorized and some are not.</p>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I like to play mainly on consoles. I play video games on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and very rarely on Steam. 
                I love to play all types of games: fighting, FPS, platformer, racing, and so many more. However, I really enjoy 
                playing horror games. My gamertag is Nightmare6402 on all platforms.</p>

            <h2>Walk/Be Outside</h2>
            <p>When I like to step away from technology, I really enjoy walking and spending time with loved ones or friends. I 
                really enjoy driving out to places I haven't been before; this adds some sense of mystery and adventure to the walks. 
                Not only does this make walks more fun, but it also provides the opportunity to find new places and see new things.</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Another hobby I have is mixing/performing with music. I do not do this as much as I would like to, but every now and 
                then I like to grab a few songs and have fun with the music. I have only ever published one song. This is because getting 
                music rights is difficult, but I mainly do it for fun and to pass the time.</p>
