            <h2>Art Work</h2>        
            <p>I really enjoy art both digital and traditional, most of my drawings start on with pencil/pen and paper and then
                further get pushed to the digital side where I can then finish up wth shading. Very few peices come out to see
                full color since I prefer to do most of my art in black and white, I find it much easier to control shading over
                coloring.
            </p>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I like to play mainly on consoles, I play video games on Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, and very rarely on Steam
                I love to play all types of games, fighting, fps, platformer, racing, and so many more however I really enjoy
                playing horror games. My gamertag is Nightmare6402 on all platforms.
            </p>

            <h2>Walk/Be Outside</h2>
            <p>When I like to step away from technology I really enjoy walking and spending time with loved ones or firends. I
                Really enjoy driving out to places I haven't been before, this adds some sense of mystery and adventure to the walks.
                Not only will this make walks more fun but it also provides the opportunity to find new places and see new things.
            </p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Another hobby I have is mixing/peforming with music. I do not do this as much as I would like to but every now and then I
                like to grab a few songs and have fun with the music. I have only ever pubished one song. This is because getting music rights is difficult
                but I mainly do it for fun and to pass the time.
