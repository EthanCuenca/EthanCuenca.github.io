        <p> Date: March 10-12 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00 </p>
        <p> Featured Artists:
            Alexander Shelley: Conductor,
            Pablo Sainz Villegas: Guitar</p>

        <p> One of the foremost conductors of his generation, Alexander Shelley joins your Colorado Symphony for a
            program that will leave you simply spellbound. Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo’s classical guitar
            concerto Concierto de Aranjuez fills the concert hall with the immortal sounds and traditions of Spanish
            romanticism in a must-hear interpretation from guitar virtuoso Pablo Sainz Villegas who was hailed as
            “The global ambassador of Spanish guitar” by Billboard Magazine. Anna Clyne’s This Midnight Hour is
            mysterious and foreboding, with musical twists and turns that show why she is considered one of the
            preeminent composers of our time. Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra was called a concerto rather than a
            symphony as each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and virtuosic way, combining elements
            of Western art music and Hungarian folk songs in a stirring finale to an evening of symphonic sublimity.</p>
