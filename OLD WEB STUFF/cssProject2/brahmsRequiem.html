        <p> Unlike other Requiem Masses, Brahms ’A German Requiem is not primarily a Mass for the dead. Instead,
            it is intended as comfort and solace for those left behind as they mourn the death of others. Confronting
            life as much as it does death, Brahms further differentiates his Requiem by setting excerpts from the
            Lutheran Bible and apocrypha in German instead of the Catholic, Latin text used in the Requiem Masses
            by Mozart, Verdi, and Berlioz. The Colorado Symphony Chorus and two vocal soloists lend distinction to
            this stunning masterpiece, which remains one of the most revered choral works ever composed. A taste
            for the exotic surfaces often in the catalogue of Maurice Ravel and his orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade
            is no exception. Named for the protagonist of One Thousand and One Nights, Shéhérazade is a woman
            who employs her imagination as a means of escape. "Je voudrais voir...", she repeats, meaning "I would
            like to see...", this refrain sets the tone for Ravel’s song cycle which drips with color evoking images of
            the far east. Drawing on music from the opera, Weber’s Overture to Oberon is a celebration of the
            supernatural realm. Like in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Weber establishes Oberon's horn as a mystical
            instrument and its call as a leitmotif throughout the overture, unleashing an exuberant conversation
            between instrumental voices and concluding with a virtuosic flourish conducted by Maestro
            Peter Oundjian.</p>
