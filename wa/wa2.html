    <h2><p>I have been working with code for about 3 to almost 4 years now. I am very familiar with git and love using the 
        git commands, personally I belive they more reliable commands to use then Git Hub Desktop. Aside from coding
        I have a few hobbies like mixing music, drawing, and playing video games.

    <h3><p>Most of my coding experience comes from my internship at Lockheed Martin. I have been able to apply all of my learning to my classes here at school.
        However there is still so much to learn, so I want to use this class to expand my knowledge and learn new coding languages like CSS, JS, HTML and so much more.
