            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a creative technology enthusiast currently pursuing a degree in Creative Technology and Design at the University of Colorado. 
                My passion lies in blending technology with creativity to produce innovative solutions and engaging experiences. I have a keen 
                interest in web development, digital art, and user experience design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy spending my free time on various hobbies. I love creating digital and traditional art, 
                playing video games, and exploring new places. I also have a passion for music and occasionally mix and perform tracks for fun. 
                My goal is to continuously learn and grow in my field, while also enjoying the creative process.
